This code will allow you to mirror bloxflip api and return the same info.

- **Cloudflare Bypass:** This will bypass Bloxflip's cloudflare protection one of the main errors people were getting was ``cloudscraper.exceptions.cloudflarechallengeerror: detected a cloudflare version 2 captcha challenge, this feature is not available in the opensource (free) version.``.

- **Hosting:** I have made this code so you can host it on any website including ``Replit``.
